# advance_nmap_scan
Advance nmap scan

Tired of just white/black block of nmap output and needs more requirements to find a vulnerability.

Please do not compare this free stuff with a commercial one..

I've created this Python code to satisfy myself (not you).. hehe

For sure, with an HTML viewer for ease of eye-catching on the prizes..

Use it wisely; I should not be responsible for any misconduct or damages while using this script.


How to execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/jimbet/advance_nmap_scan.git
cd advance_nmap_scan
chmod +x jim_nmap_scanner.py
chmod +x requirement.sh
bash requirements.sh
python jim_nmap_scanner.py
```
